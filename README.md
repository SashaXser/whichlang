# Whichlang

This is a language detection library, aiming for both precision and performance.

# Features

- No dependency
- Throughput above 100 MB/s for short and long strings.
- Good accuracy (99.5% on my validation dataset, but it really depends on the size of your input.)

# How does it work?

It uses a multiclass logistic regression model over:
- 2, 3, 4-grams of letters on ASCII
- codepoint / 128
- a slightly smarter projection of codepoints over a given class.

We use the hashing trick and project these features over a space of size `4_096`.

The logistic regression is trained in the python notebook attached,
and used to generate `weight.rs`.

# Comparison with [Whatlang](https://github.com/greyblake/whatlang-rs)

The following compares the throughput using the simple benchmark found in this repository and the accuracy using [whatlang-accuracy-benchmark](https://github.com/evanxg852000/whatlang-accuracy-benchmark) benchmark. Overall, Whichlang is about 10x faster and slightly more accurate than Whatlang.

### Throughput

|                           | Processing Time (Âµs) | Throughput (MiB/s) |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | 
| whatlang/short            | 16.62                | 1.66               | 
| whatlang/long             | 62.00                | 9.42               | 
| whichlang/short           | 0.26                 | 105.69             | 
| whichlang/long            | 5.21                 | 112.31             | 

### Accuracy

|            | Size <= 20 | 21-50  | 51-100 | Size > 100 | AVG    |
| -----------| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Whatlang   | 78.74%     | 92.04% | 97.37% | 98.61%     | 91.69% |
| Whichlang  | 92.10%     | 97.55% | 99.06% | 99.39%     | 97.03% |
